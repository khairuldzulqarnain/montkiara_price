In this process I have used uipath web scraping to scrape IProperty website. The Data should be filtered by Subsale unit, Mont Kiara area and specific on service apartments. This chateria matched with our new launch project in future.

5) High level process description
The high level requirement of this process is to manually read the property prices, sizes, prices per sq ft etc and write back to the excel files.
Human error may occured during read and write back to excel files.

6) Duration
It took around 3 weeks to complete this process

7) Challenges faced
Website Structure Changes: Websites often undergo structural changes over time, such as layout modifications or changes in HTML code. These changes can disrupt your web scraping process, as the UiPath robots may not be able to locate the required data elements accurately.
Data Accuracy and Reliability: Web scraping relies on the assumption that the data on the target website is accurate and reliable. However, there can be inconsistencies or errors in the data source, which may lead to inaccurate benchmarking results.
